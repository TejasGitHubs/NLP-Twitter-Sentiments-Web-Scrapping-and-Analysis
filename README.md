# NLP-Twitter-Sentiments-Web-Scrapping-and-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis on iPhone Launch and Purchase Behaviours
In this project, I used natural language processing (NLP) and web scraping techniques to analyze the sentiment of Twitter users towards different iPhone launches and models. I collected a large dataset of tweets related to iPhone launches and models using web scraping tools, and used R and NLP libraries to preprocess and analyze the text data.
I used word clouds and polarity analysis to visualize the overall sentiment of the tweets, and conducted sentiment analysis to classify the tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. I also used statistical modeling techniques, such as regression and classification, to identify factors that influence the sentiment of the tweets, such as the type of iPhone model, the timing of the launch, and the presence of certain keywords.
Based on my analysis, I prepared a report and presentation to communicate my findings and recommendations to stakeholders, such as iPhone marketers and product managers. The report included visualizations, such as word clouds and sentiment plots, and statistical tables and graphs to support the findings. The presentation included a summary of the key findings and recommendations, along with examples of tweets and analysis results to illustrate the points.
The goal of this project was to use data science techniques to understand the sentiment of Twitter users towards different iPhone launches and models, and to provide insights and recommendations for iPhone marketing and product development. By conducting this analysis, I contributed to the understanding of social media sentiment analysis and its applications in the technology industry.
